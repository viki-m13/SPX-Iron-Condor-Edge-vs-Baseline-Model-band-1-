**SPX Iron Condor — Edge vs Baseline Band Model (band ≤ 1.0%)**

This model is a **1-day SPX iron condor forecaster**. For each trading day it decides whether to trade a very tight symmetric band around SPX for the next session, or stay flat. When it trades, it predicts that tomorrow’s close will stay inside

> [ base_close × (1 − band_pct), base_close × (1 + band_pct) ]

using daily **SPX (^GSPC)** and **VIX (^VIX)** data from yfinance.

Filters are based on:

* **Realized volatility** (average absolute daily return over a lookback window)
* **VIX level** (low implied volatility)
* **Trend filter** (close above SMA when `use_trend = true`)

A grid search over these parameters and **band widths up to 1%** is used to **maximize “edge vs baseline”**, not just raw hit rate.

## Baseline and edge_vs_baseline

**Baseline hit rate**
The **baseline** is the unconditional probability that a 1-day SPX move stays inside the same band if you traded it every single day, with no filters:

> baseline_hit_rate = P( |1-day SPX return| ≤ band_pct )

This is computed over the full sample of daily returns.

**Model hit rate**
The **model hit rate** is the conditional probability that the same band finishes inside, but **only on days when the filters fire a signal** (`signal_today = true`). This measures how good the filters are at picking calmer days for that payoff.

**Edge vs baseline**

> edge_vs_baseline = hit_rate − baseline_hit_rate

This is the **lift in win rate** versus the naive “trade every day” strategy for the same band. It is the core measure of **edge** the model is optimized to maximize.

## Key configurations and results (2010–2024, daily SPX)

1. **Higher coverage, strong edge** — band_pct = 0.006 (±0.6% band)

**Best params:**

* band_pct = **0.006**
* avgabs_window = **3**
* avgabs_max = **0.005**
* vix_max = **13**
* sma_n = **12**
* use_trend = **true**

**Results:**

* Total days: **3,990**
* Signals (trades): **513**
* Signal rate: **~12.9%** of days
* Model hit rate: **84.41%**
* Baseline hit rate: **57.27%**
* **Edge vs baseline: +27.14 percentage points**

**Interpretation:**
If you sold a **±0.6% 1-day iron condor** every day, you’d be inside the band about **57%** of the time. If you only sell it when this model signals, you’re inside about **84%** of the time. The model adds roughly **27 percentage points of hit-rate edge** over the unconditional baseline.

2. **Lower coverage, maximal edge** — band_pct = 0.004 (±0.4% band)

**Best params:**

* band_pct = **0.004**
* avgabs_window = **10**
* avgabs_max = **0.004**
* vix_max = **12**
* sma_n = **12**
* use_trend = **true**

**Results:**

* Total days: **3,983**
* Signals (trades): **229**
* Signal rate: **~5.7%** of days
* Model hit rate: **76.86%**
* Baseline hit rate: **43.64%**
* **Edge vs baseline: +33.22 percentage points**

**Interpretation:**
For a tighter **±0.4% band**, trading every day would only finish inside about **44%** of the time. Restricting to the model’s signals lifts that to about **77%**, adding **over 33 percentage points of hit-rate edge**, at the cost of trading less frequently.

## Overall

The model is designed as a **filter**: it does not try to predict direction, only whether SPX is likely to remain inside a **very tight 1-day range**. The primary performance metric is **edge_vs_baseline**, which quantifies how much better a conditional, filtered strategy is compared to blindly trading the same 1-day band every day.
